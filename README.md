# IntrotoAlgorithm
- Using Python/C++ to implement codes in Introduction to Algorithms
- Feel free to fork 
- Any suggestion will be appreciated
- All my work will be uploaded randomly 
- Python is **good** !!!!!
- *However, after I watching NOI's students' code, I found that C++ is also great.*


### Note:

I'm actually doing problems not only in *Introduction to algorithms* but also the purple book of *Liurujia*. 

And for now, C++ codes are not uploaded since they are not orginally supposed to be in the same folder. But I'm gonna fix that soon.
