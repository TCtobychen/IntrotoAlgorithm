# IntrotoAlgorithm
- Using Python/C++ to implement codes in Introduction to Algorithms
- Any suggestion will be appreciated
- All my work will be uploaded randomly 
- ~~Python is **good** !!!!!~~  ==I realize that C++ is more suitable for programming==
- *However, after my watching NOI's students' code, I found that C++ is also great.*


### Note:

I'm actually doing problems not only in *Introduction to algorithms* but also the purple book of *Liurujia* and some NOIP problems for training.
